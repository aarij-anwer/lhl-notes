# Higher-Order Functions and Callbacks

Higher-Order functions are any functions which operate on other functions.

Higer-order functions follows one of these two rules:
1. Accepts one or more functions as arguments
2. Returns one or more functions as a result.

Callback is a function passed into another for later execution.

Built-in functions such as forEach, filter, and others can be called "Higher-Order Functions".

Higher-Order functions are a major aspect of Functional Programming.
