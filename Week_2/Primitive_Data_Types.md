# Primitive Data Types

> In JavaScript, all values which are not Objects are collectively referred to as primitives.

Let's review the six types of primitives:
-`undefined`
-`null`
-`boolean`
-`string`
-`number`
-`symbol` (Introduced in ES6 and not something we need to focus on right now)

The six primitive types, plus `object`, make up the seven fundamental types of JavaScript.
