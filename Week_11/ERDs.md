# Five Key Parts of an ERD

* Entity - anything whose data needs to be represented
* Attribute - characteristics of an entity
* Primary Key - the unique identifier for an entity
* Relationship - how entities are related
* Cardinality - dependencies

## Cardinality

Is it needed?
* Optional - O 
* Mandatory - |

Types of depedencies
* 1-to-many
* 1-to-1
* Many-to-many

## Composite Keys

Needed when one identifier does not suffice as PK (e.g. https://youtu.be/-fQ-bRllhXc?t=540). 

## Pivot Tables

When having many-to-many relationships (e.g. employees/projects, students/classes, etc.) you need a pivot or composite table to simplify the relationships.
